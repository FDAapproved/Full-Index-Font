# Full Index Font
It always bothered me that 'indexfont' in GZDoom doesn't have a full set of characters, so I've deviced to make a 'full' version of the font that has the same size. Some characters are truncated to make them work within the restrictive sprite size (5x3 plus a dropshadow), but the font is legible.
